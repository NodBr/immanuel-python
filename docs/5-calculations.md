# Calculations

## Secondary Progressions

Immanuel calculates progressions in the same way as [astro.com](https://astro.com). The natal date is progressed by the same formula and the same three MC progression methods are available to calculate houses:

| Method | Astro.com Equivalent | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Naibod | ARMC 1 Naibod/prog.day | Advances the ARMC by the Sun's mean daily motion multiplied by the number of days between the natal and progressed date. |
| Solar Arc | MC from solar arc | ARMC is calculated by advancing the MC by the same distance the Sun has traveled between the natal and progressed date. |
| Daily Houses | ARMC 361Â°/prog.day | Calculates where the ARMC would be on the progressed date. |

See the [Settings](6-settings.md#mc_progression_method) section to see how to pick a method, otherwise Immanuel will default to Naibod.

## Composites

Composite charts are calculated by midpoint. This will apply to everything in the chart, including houses and house-based points such as the Part of Fortune and Vertex.

## Dignity Scores

The planets all feature diginity scores which, by default, are based on [Astro Gold's scoring system](https://www.astrogold.io/AG-MacOS-Help/essential_dignities.html), but which can be changed. Immanuel's [settings](6-settings.md#rulerships) allow both the dignity calculations and the scores to be customized. Various alternative rulership, triplicity, and term tables are available to use, and participatory triplicities and mutual receptions can be included or excluded.
